      KEY CHANGES FOR AUTOPLAY:
      - autoplay: Tells the browser to start playing as soon as it can.
      - muted:   THIS IS REQUIRED for autoplay to work on mobile.
      - playsinline: Essential for iOS to play it on the page, not in the native player.
      - loop:    Keeps the video repeating.
      - NO "controls" attribute is present, so the timeline is hidden.
